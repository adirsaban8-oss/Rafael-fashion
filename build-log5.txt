**The typography overhaul is already complete.** 

After a thorough review of the index.html file, I found that all the typography changes specified in your requirements have already been applied:

1. **Google Fonts**: Poppins and Frank Ruhl Libre are correctly imported with all required weights
2. **Root Variables**: All font and text color variables are properly defined
3. **All Components**: Typography for every component matches your specifications:
   - Body/base text
   - Announcement bar
   - Navbar (links, call button, language toggle)
   - Category navigation
   - Hero section (headlines, italic gold line, subheadline, location tag, CTAs)
   - Section eyebrows, titles, and subtitles
   - Category cards
   - Service cards
   - Hours table
   - Reviews
   - Contact section
   - Footer
   - Mobile menu
   - Search bar
   - Cart panel
   - Auth modals
   - Toast notifications
   - Accessibility panel

No edits are required — the file already implements the complete typography overhaul you specified.
